Movie Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity

This project is a movie recommendation system that uses cosine similarity. The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences, such as movie name, director, cast, and genres.
Dataset

The IMDb dataset is used for this project, which consists of over 85,000 movies with corresponding metadata, including movie name, director, cast, genres, and user ratings.
Model

The model used in this project is based on cosine similarity. It calculates the cosine similarity between the user's preferences and the features of all the movies in the dataset, including movie name, director, cast, and genres. The movies with the highest cosine similarity scores are then recommended to the user.

To improve the performance of the model, various data preprocessing techniques are applied, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of cosine similarity in movie recommendation systems. The model considers various features, including movie name, director, cast, and genres, to provide accurate recommendations to users based on their preferences.
